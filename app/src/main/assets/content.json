However, the key takeaway from the calculation above is that when no investments are made, the cash that is saved does not grow and remains almost flat over time.\n\nNow let us look at a different situation. Instead of keeping the surplus money idle, assume you decide to invest it in an option that grows at around 12% per year. For instance, in the first year you manage to save ₹2,40,000. If this amount is invested at a 12% annual return and allowed to grow for nearly 20 years (assuming the investment is made at the end of the first year), it can grow to about ₹20,67,000 by the end of the twentieth year.\n\nFor those curious about how this growth is calculated, it follows a simple compounding formula:\n\n₹2,40,000 × (1 + 12%)¹⁹\n\nFinal value ≈ ₹20,67,000\n\nThere is no need to focus on the mathematics right now. The detailed explanation of this calculation will be covered later in this module and in other learning sections as well.\n\nBelow is a representation of how your yearly savings can grow over time when surplus cash is invested consistently.\n\nWhen surplus income is invested, the final cash balance increases significantly. In this scenario, the total amount grows to approximately ₹4.26 crore, compared to about ₹1.7 crore when no investments are made. This means the invested amount grows to nearly 2.4 times the value achieved without investing.\n\nClearly, choosing to invest places you in a much stronger financial position, especially when planning for life after retirement.\n\nComing back to the original question — why should one invest?\nThere are a few strong reasons:\n\nBeat Inflation\nInvesting helps protect money against inflation, which is the continuous rise in the cost of living over time.\n\nBuild Wealth\nThrough investing, it is possible to create a larger financial corpus by the end of a chosen time period. This goal could be retirement, children’s education, buying a house, marriage expenses, travel, or any other long-term objective."

In these instruments, the investor lends money to an entity, which in return pays a fixed interest on the invested amount. One of the most common examples of a fixed-income instrument is a bank’s fixed deposit.\n\nThe interest earned on such investments can be paid at regular intervals such as quarterly, half-yearly, or yearly. Once the investment tenure is completed, the original invested amount is returned to the investor. This duration is commonly referred to as the maturity period.\n\nSome common examples of fixed-income instruments include:\n\nBank fixed deposits\n\nBonds issued by the Government of India (also known as government securities and treasury bills)\n\nBonds issued by government-backed organizations such as GAIL, HUDCO, NHAI, and similar agencies\n\nBonds issued by private companies (for example, Tata, Bajaj, Reliance, Adani)\n\nTypically, returns from fixed-income instruments vary depending on the level of risk involved. Bank fixed deposits usually offer moderate returns, government bonds provide slightly higher returns with high safety, and certain corporate bonds may offer higher returns due to increased risk. Among these, government bonds are generally viewed as the safest option because they carry minimal default risk."

When investing hard-earned money, it is important to have strong regulations, checks, and safeguards in place to protect investors. At present, cryptocurrencies lack a clear regulatory framework, and therefore it may be prudent to avoid them until proper regulations are established.\n\nIdeally, investments should not be concentrated in a single asset class. A balanced mix across different asset categories helps reduce risk and improve stability. Distributing money across various asset classes is known as asset allocation, a concept that will be discussed in detail later.\n\nFor example, a young working professional can afford to take higher risks due to a longer investment horizon. Such an investor may allocate around 60% of investable funds to equity, 20% to precious metals, and 20% to fixed-income instruments. This allocation gradually changes with age and risk tolerance. A retired individual, for instance, may prefer to invest a larger portion — possibly 80% — in safer fixed-income options such as government bonds."

However, before beginning your investment journey, it is important to keep the following points in mind:\n\nRisk and return are closely linked.\nHigher potential returns usually come with higher risk, while lower risk investments generally offer lower returns.\n\nFixed-income investments focus on capital protection.\nThese options are comparatively safer and aim to protect the invested amount. However, after adjusting for inflation, real returns may turn negative. For example, if an investment gives a return of 9% while inflation is at 10%, the actual purchasing power reduces by about 1% annually. The risk level increases further when investing in corporate fixed-income instruments.\n\nEquity investments are effective for long-term growth.\nOver extended periods, equities have shown the ability to outperform inflation. Historically, equity markets have delivered average returns in the range of 14–15%. That said, equity investments carry higher volatility and risk.\n\nReal estate requires large capital and lacks liquidity.\nProperty investments usually need a substantial upfront amount and cannot be made with small sums. Additionally, real estate is not very liquid, meaning it may not be easy to buy or sell property whenever needed.\n\nGold and silver are relatively stable investments.\nPrecious metals are generally considered safer options, but their long-term returns are usually lower compared to equities. They are better suited for stability and diversification rather than high growth."

The next question is how one actually invests in equities. Before going deeper into this topic, it is important to understand the overall market system and the different participants that make the capital market function smoothly.\n\nJust as we visit a nearby kirana store or a supermarket to buy daily essentials, we approach the stock market to carry out investment transactions. The stock market is the place where people come to buy and sell shares. In this context, a transaction simply means the purchase or sale of company shares. The main role of the stock market is to enable these transactions by bringing buyers and sellers together. If you wish to buy shares of a company, the stock market helps connect you with someone who wants to sell them, and vice versa.\n\nUnlike a physical marketplace, the stock market does not exist as a brick-and-mortar location. It operates entirely in electronic form. Investors access the stock market digitally through computers or mobile devices to place buy or sell orders. It is also important to note that individuals cannot access the stock market directly; transactions are carried out through registered intermediaries known as stockbrokers. Stockbrokers will be discussed in more detail later.\n\nIn India, there are two main stock exchanges — the Bombay Stock Exchange (BSE) and the National Stock Exchange (NSE). Although several regional stock exchanges existed earlier, most of them have either merged with BSE or NSE or have ceased operations. Therefore, when we refer to the Indian stock market today, we are primarily referring to either the NSE or the BSE."

A stockbroker is a corporate organization that is registered as a trading member with a stock exchange and holds a valid stockbroking license. This license is issued by SEBI after proper verification, and the broker is required to follow all rules and regulations laid down by SEBI.\n\nA stockbroker acts as your entry point to the stock markets, enabling you to invest in shares, bonds, ETFs, and mutual funds. To trade in the stock market, you must first open an account with a broker of your choice. There are many brokers registered in India, and investors usually select one based on personal preferences. Some common factors people consider while choosing a broker include:\n\nEase of use and simplicity of the broker’s trading platform\n\nQuality and responsiveness of customer support\n\nAvailability of useful reports such as Profit & Loss statements, trade history, and tax reports\n\nFinancial strength of the broker (it is better to avoid brokers with weak financials)\n\nValue-added initiatives such as investor education and learning resources\n\nOnce you choose a broker and open a trading and DEMAT account, you can begin participating in the stock market. After your account is active, there are a few standard ways through which you can place trades using your broker:\n\nPlacing orders via phone – You can contact your broker, verify your identity using your client or account code, and request the dealer to place a trade on your behalf. The dealer executes the order and confirms the transaction status during the call.\n\nSelf-directed trading – This is the most commonly used method today. The broker provides access to a digital trading platform or trading terminal. After logging in, you can view live market prices and place buy or sell orders on your own. For example, Zerodha’s trading platform is known as Kite.\n\nProgrammatic trading via APIs – Experienced users can connect to the market using APIs provided by certain brokers. These services are usually offered for an additional fee and are suitable for advanced or automated trading strategies.\n\nThe key services typically offered by a stockbroker include:\n\nProviding access to the stock markets and enabling trade execution\n\nOffering margin facilities for trading (this will be discussed later)\n\nCustomer support through calls, emails, or chat to resolve issues and provide guidance\n\nIssuing contract notes for all trades — a contract note is an official record of the transactions carried out during the day\n\nEnabling fund transfers between your trading account and linked bank account\n\nProviding access to a back-office system, which is a portal containing detailed reports and account information (for example, Zerodha’s back-office platform is called Console)."

This makes it important to keep those documents safe and secure.\n\nIn a similar way, when you buy shares (which represent partial ownership in a company), ownership was earlier established through a share certificate. A share certificate is simply a document that confirms your ownership in a company. Until 1996, share certificates existed only in physical form. After that, they were converted into electronic form. This process of converting physical share certificates into digital form is known as dematerialization, commonly called DEMAT.\n\nThe move to digital shareholding gained momentum after major market events highlighted the need for a safer and more transparent system. Digitization helped improve efficiency, reduce fraud, and simplify share ownership.\n\nOnce shares are converted into DEMAT form, they must be stored electronically. This digital storage is known as a DEMAT account. A depository is a financial intermediary that provides DEMAT account services. You can think of a DEMAT account as a secure digital locker where your shares are stored. Your trading account with the broker and your DEMAT account with the depository are linked to each other.\n\nFor example, if you want to buy shares of a company like Infosys, you simply place a buy order through your trading account. Once the transaction is completed, the shares are automatically credited to your DEMAT account.\n\nSimilarly, when you decide to sell shares, you place a sell order using your trading account. While the selling action happens through the trading platform, the linked DEMAT account is debited in the background for the shares that are sold.\n\nCurrently, there are only two depositories in India that provide DEMAT account services: National Securities Depository Limited (NSDL) and Central Depository Services (India) Limited (CDSL). There is very little difference between the two, and both operate under strict regulations prescribed by SEBI."

Once a trade is executed, the seller cannot withdraw from the transaction, and the buyer must fulfill the payment obligation. This prevents any party from backing out after the trade is confirmed.\n\nFor most investors and traders, there is no need to understand the internal workings of NSE Clearing Limited or ICCL in detail.

This is only the visible surface. In reality, the stock market is a complex ecosystem where many players operate behind the scenes. These players may not place trades the way retail investors do, but they strongly influence price movement, liquidity, volatility, and long-term trends.\n\nUnderstanding these hidden participants helps explain why markets behave irrationally at times and why prices often move even when there is no obvious news.\n\nMarket Makers and Liquidity Providers\n\nMarket makers and liquidity providers ensure that there is always a buyer or seller available in the market. They continuously quote buy and sell prices and earn through spreads rather than directional bets.\n\nKey points:\n\nThey reduce sudden price gaps and extreme volatility.\n\nThey make it possible for retail traders to enter and exit positions easily.\n\nThey benefit from seeing aggregated order flow, which gives them structural advantages.\n\nWithout them, markets would become illiquid and chaotic, especially during volatile periods.\n\nCustodians and Clearing Institutions\n\nCustodians and clearing banks handle the actual settlement of trades. While brokers execute orders, these institutions ensure that shares and money are exchanged correctly between parties.\n\nTheir role includes:\n\nHolding securities on behalf of institutions.\n\nManaging settlement, dividends, bonuses, and corporate actions.\n\nReducing counterparty risk.\n\nRetail investors rarely hear about them, but if these entities fail or delay settlement, the entire market can freeze.\n\nMutual Funds and Active Fund Managers\n\nMutual funds pool money from thousands or millions of investors and deploy it through professional fund managers. Their trades are large enough to influence prices and valuations.\n\nImportant aspects:\n\nThey create sustained buying or selling pressure.\n\nTheir entry often legitimizes a stock or sector.\n\nTheir exits can trigger panic among retail investors.\n\nThey do not just follow trends; in many cases, they define them.\n\nPassive Funds, Index Funds, and ETFs\n\nPassive funds do not analyze stocks individually. They simply replicate indices. Despite this simplicity, they control enormous amounts of capital.\n\nWhy they matter:\n\nTheir buying and selling is automatic and rule-based.\n\nStocks included in indices receive consistent inflows.\n\nWhen markets fall, these funds sell mechanically, increasing volatility.\n\nThey move markets not through intelligence, but through scale.\n\nProprietary Trading Firms\n\nProprietary trading firms trade using their own capital rather than client money. They focus on short-term opportunities, arbitrage, and derivatives.\n\nCharacteristics:\n\nExtremely fast execution.\n\nHeavy use of data and models.\n\nDominant presence in intraday and futures trading.\n\nRetail traders often mistake their activity for “smart money,” but they are operating on a completely different battlefield.\n\nHigh-Frequency Trading (HFT) Systems\n\nHFTs are algorithmic systems designed to exploit speed advantages. They place and cancel thousands of orders within milliseconds.\n\nTheir influence includes:\n\nCreating the illusion of liquidity.\n\nIncreasing short-term volatility.\n\nAmplifying crashes when they suddenly withdraw from the market.\n\nIn times of stress, these systems often shut down, leaving markets exposed.\n\nForeign Institutional Investors (FIIs / FPIs)\n\nForeign investors move capital across countries based on global conditions rather than local fundamentals.\n\nThey are influenced by:\n\nInterest rates in developed economies.\n\nCurrency movements.\n\nGeopolitical risks and global liquidity.\n\nA single month of foreign selling can overpower years of retail inflows, making them one of the strongest market-moving forces.\n\nCredit Rating Agencies\n\nCredit rating agencies evaluate the creditworthiness of companies and financial instruments. Their opinions affect institutional participation.\n\nWhy they matter:\n\nDowngrades can trigger sharp sell-offs.\n\nMany institutions are restricted from investing below certain ratings.\n\nTheir actions influence perception more than fundamentals.\n\nMarkets often react more strongly to ratings than to actual balance sheet changes.\n\nResearch Analysts, Media, and Market Narratives\n\nFinancial media, brokerage research, and market commentators shape how information is perceived.\n\nTheir role:\n\nFraming narratives around results, budgets, and policies.\n\nInfluencing retail sentiment and expectations.\n\nAmplifying fear or optimism.\n\nMarkets move on expectations, and these players largely control those expectations.\n\nCorporate Promoters and Insiders\n\nPromoters and senior management are closest to the real condition of a company.\n\nTheir influence comes from:\n\nTiming of fund-raising, buybacks, and dividends.\n\nStrategic disclosures.\n\nCapital allocation decisions.\n\nEven when acting legally, their decisions often precede visible market movements.\n\nAuditors and Professional Consultants\n\nAuditors, valuation experts, and consultants validate the financial information that markets rely on.\n\nTheir importance lies in:\n\nEstablishing trust in reported numbers.\n\nPreventing misinformation from spreading.\n\nMaintaining confidence in corporate disclosures.\n\nWhen this trust breaks, stock prices can collapse instantly.\n\nTechnology and Infrastructure Providers\n\nStock markets depend heavily on technology providers who build and maintain trading, risk, and data systems.\n\nThey control:\n\nMarket uptime and stability.\n\nData accuracy and speed.\n\nSystemic risk management.\n\nA technical failure can halt trading and shake investor confidence within minutes.\n\nThe Bigger Reality\n\nThe stock market is not driven purely by supply and demand between buyers and sellers. It is shaped by a layered structure of influence where capital size, speed, information access, and narrative control matter more than individual intelligence.\n\nRetail investors are participants, but not controllers.\n\nUnderstanding these hidden players does not guarantee profits, but it provides something far more valuable:\nclarity about why markets behave the way they do and protection from emotional decision-making."

Along the way, we will also get introduced to a few important financial ideas related to this process.\n\nBefore directly answering why companies choose to go public, let us first understand a basic concept — how a typical business begins and evolves.

The designs are distinctive, the pricing is appealing, and premium quality cotton is used to produce the t-shirts. The entrepreneur is confident that the idea will succeed and is excited to turn it into a business.\n\nAs expected, the entrepreneur soon faces a common challenge — arranging funds to start the business. Since there is no prior business background, attracting professional investors at this early stage is difficult. In most such cases, the entrepreneur reaches out to close family members and friends to present the idea and raise initial capital.\n\nAssume that the entrepreneur invests some personal savings and also convinces two close friends to put money into the venture. These two friends decide to invest based on trust and belief in the entrepreneur. In this scenario, these friends are known as angel investors. It is important to note that angel funding is not a loan; it is an investment made in the business.\n\nNow, let us assume that the promoter (entrepreneur) along with the angel investors raise ₹5 crore as capital. This first round of funding, which helps the business begin its operations, is known as the Seed Fund. It is also sometimes referred to as a Friends and Family round. An important point to remember is that this money is deposited into the company’s bank account, not the personal account of the entrepreneur.\n\nAngel funding does not always come only from friends or relatives. There are also professional angel investors who invest in early-stage companies they believe have strong potential.\n\nIn exchange for this initial investment, the three individuals involved (the promoter and the two angels) are issued shares of the company, which gives them ownership in the business. At this stage, the company’s primary asset is cash. Therefore, the value of the company is largely based on the cash it holds. In this example, the valuation is ₹5 crore. One could argue that the company’s value should also include the strength of the business idea, which may push the valuation higher, but we will not go into that discussion here.\n\nIssuing shares at this stage is straightforward. The company assumes a face value of ₹10 per share. Since the total share capital is ₹5 crore, the company issues 50 lakh shares, each having a face value of ₹10. In this context, ₹10 is referred to as the Face Value (FV) of the share. The face value can typically be any amount, commonly ranging from ₹1 to ₹10."

By the end of the first two years, the company reaches a break-even point. The promoter is no longer inexperienced; instead, they now have a better understanding of the business and greater confidence in its potential. With this confidence, the promoter plans to scale the business by setting up an additional manufacturing unit and opening a few more retail outlets in the city. After working through the expansion plan, the entrepreneur estimates that ₹7 crore of fresh capital will be required.\n\nCompared to two years earlier, the entrepreneur is now in a much stronger position. The key difference is that the business is earning revenue. This consistent inflow validates both the business model and the product offering. At this stage, the entrepreneur can approach more informed and professional investors. Investors who typically fund businesses at this growth stage are known as Venture Capitalists (VCs), and the funding received at this point is referred to as Series A funding.\n\nLet us assume the entrepreneur successfully raises the required ₹7 crore for expansion. Generally, when new capital is infused into a business, the following outcomes occur:\n\nThe promoter’s ownership gets diluted as new shares are issued.\n\nThe overall valuation of the company increases.\n\nAs a result, the early investors (in this case, the angel investors) begin to see notional gains on their initial investment. With the entry of venture capital funding, the company’s valuation rises, leading to an increase in notional wealth for all existing shareholders."

Any spending done to strengthen and grow the business in this manner is referred to as Capital Expenditure, commonly known as CAPEX.\n\nThe management estimates that around ₹40 crore will be required to meet these CAPEX needs. This raises an important question — how does the company arrange such a large amount of money, or in other words, how can the business fund its CAPEX plans?\n\nThere are a few common ways through which a company can raise funds for CAPEX:\n\nInternal accruals\nOver the past few years, the company has generated profits. A portion of the required CAPEX can be funded using these retained earnings. This method of funding is known as internal accruals.\n\nAnother round of venture capital funding\nThe company may approach another venture capitalist and raise fresh funds by issuing additional shares. This type of funding round is usually referred to as Series B funding.\n\nBank loan (Debt)\nThe company can also approach a bank for a loan. Since the business has been performing well, the bank may be willing to lend money. Such borrowing is commonly called debt.\n\nLet us assume the company uses all three options to fund its CAPEX. It contributes ₹15 crore from internal accruals, raises ₹10 crore by giving up some equity in a Series B funding round, and borrows ₹15 crore as debt from a bank.\n\nIt is important to note that the company’s valuation increases again due to the ₹10 crore raised through Series B funding. As valuations rise, earlier investors benefit by seeing higher notional gains on their investments."

The company decides to expand its operations across the country. At the same time, it plans to diversify by entering new product categories such as fashion accessories, premium cosmetics, and perfumes.\n\nTo support these larger goals, the CAPEX requirement increases to ₹60 crore. The company chooses not to raise this money through debt because interest costs, also known as finance charges, reduce profitability. For example, if a company earns ₹100 in profit but pays ₹20 as interest, the effective profit comes down to ₹80. This impact of debt on profits will be discussed in more detail later in the Fundamental Analysis module.\n\nAt this stage, the company opts for Series C funding. Raising funds from a typical venture capitalist is not suitable anymore, as VC investments are generally smaller and usually limited to a few crores. This is where a Private Equity (PE) investor steps in. You can think of a PE investor as a more powerful and mature version of a VC. Some key differences between Venture Capital and Private Equity are outlined below:\n\nVenture Capital firms usually invest smaller amounts, whereas Private Equity firms invest significantly larger sums.\n\nVCs typically invest in early-stage businesses and take higher risks. PEs invest in more mature companies and therefore face relatively lower risk.\n\nPrivate Equity investors often take a seat on the company’s board and actively monitor and guide the company’s operations.\n\nPrivate Equity investors are generally highly experienced and professionally skilled. They invest substantial capital with the objective of long-term value creation. In addition, they place their representatives on the board of the investee company to ensure the business moves in the intended strategic direction."

The company plans to make its brand available in major international cities, with at least two outlets in each key global market.\n\nTo achieve this, the company needs to invest heavily in market research to understand international consumers, hire skilled talent, and further increase manufacturing capacity. In addition, the company must invest in real estate across different countries. The required CAPEX is substantial, and the management estimates this at around ₹200 crore.

When a company files for an IPO, it offers its shares to the general public for the first time. Members of the public can choose to buy these shares by paying a specified price. Since this is the company’s first offer of shares to public investors, it is called an Initial Public Offer.\n\nAt this stage, we reach an important turning point where several key questions arise:\n\nWhy did the company choose to file for an IPO?\n\nIn general, why do companies decide to go public?\n\nWhy did the company not opt for an IPO during the earlier Series A, B, or C funding stages?\n\nWhat happens to the existing shareholders once the company goes public?\n\nWhat factors does the general public consider before subscribing to an IPO?\n\nHow does the IPO process unfold step by step?\n\nWhich financial intermediaries are involved in the IPO process?"

The purpose of that illustrative journey was to show how companies mature over time. While several real-world complexities were intentionally simplified, the focus was on highlighting the different growth phases of a business and the funding choices available at each stage.\n\nUnderstanding the reasons behind an IPO is very important, as the IPO market—also known as the primary market—often attracts first-time investors. In this section, we will explore the IPO process and the various factors that influence a company’s decision to go public.\n\nWe ended the earlier section with an important question: why does a company choose to file for an IPO? More broadly, what motivates companies to enter the public markets?\n\nWhen a company plans an IPO, one of the primary reasons is to raise capital to fund its CAPEX requirements. Apart from this, there are several other motivations. In some cases, companies use IPO proceeds to reduce expensive debt. In other situations, an IPO allows early investors to partially or fully exit their investments. Think of any company that went public recently and look up its IPO rationale—you will understand the reason behind its listing.\n\nFor promoters, taking a company public offers several key advantages:\n\nRaising funds for CAPEX needs\nAn IPO provides access to large amounts of capital required for expansion and long-term growth.\n\nReducing dependence on debt\nBy raising equity instead of borrowing, the company avoids interest costs, which improves overall profitability.\n\nRisk distribution\nThe promoter can spread business risk across a large base of investors rather than relying on a single large investor. Having thousands of retail investors is often preferable to depending on one private equity firm.\n\nThere are additional benefits of going public:\n\nExit opportunity for early investors\nOnce the company is listed, its shares can be freely traded in the market. Existing shareholders such as promoters, angel investors, venture capitalists, or private equity funds can sell their shares and realize returns on their initial investments (subject to lock-in rules).\n\nEmployee rewards through ownership\nEmployees may be granted shares as part of incentive plans known as Employee Stock Option Plans (ESOPs). These shares are usually allotted at a discounted price. After listing, employees can benefit from appreciation in the company’s share price, aligning their interests with the company’s growth."

One of the very first and most critical steps is appointing a merchant banker. Merchant bankers are also known as Book Running Lead Managers (BRLMs) or Lead Managers (LMs).\n\nThe primary responsibility of a merchant banker is to guide and support the company through different stages of the IPO process. Their key roles include:\n\nDue diligence – Conduct a detailed review of the company planning to launch an IPO, ensure regulatory and legal compliance, and issue a due diligence certificate.\n\nPreparation of IPO documents – Work closely with the company to draft and finalize important listing documents, including the Draft Red Herring Prospectus (DRHP). This will be discussed in more detail later.\n\nUnderwriting the issue – In underwriting, merchant bankers agree to subscribe to the portion of the IPO that remains unsubscribed. This applies to newly issued shares in the IPO. If the subscription falls short of a specified threshold, the IPO is considered unsuccessful, and investors’ blocked funds are released. If the subscription is above the threshold but not fully subscribed, the merchant banker absorbs the remaining shares.\n\nPrice band determination – Assist the company in deciding the IPO price band, which defines the lower and upper price limits at which shares are offered to investors. For example, an IPO may have a price band ranging between two specified prices.\n\nRoadshows and promotion – Support the company in conducting roadshows, which are marketing and promotional activities aimed at generating investor interest in the IPO.\n\nAppointment of other intermediaries – Help the company select and appoint other key entities involved in the IPO process, such as registrars, bankers, and advertising agencies.\n\nOverall, merchant bankers play a central role in coordinating the IPO process and ensuring that the company meets regulatory requirements while successfully raising capital from the public markets."

Broadly, an IPO moves through the following stages:\n\nAppointment of a merchant banker\nThe company first appoints a merchant banker. In the case of a large public issue, more than one merchant banker may be appointed.\n\nFiling with SEBI (Registration Statement)\nThe company submits a registration statement to SEBI. This document explains the company’s business, the reason for going public, and its financial condition.\n\nSEBI’s approval\nAfter reviewing the registration statement, SEBI decides whether to grant approval or reject the proposal. Only after a positive nod can the company proceed further.\n\nDraft Red Herring Prospectus (DRHP)\nOnce SEBI grants initial approval, the company prepares the DRHP. This document is circulated to the public and contains detailed information such as:\n\nEstimated size of the IPO\n\nApproximate number of shares to be offered\n\nPurpose of raising funds and planned utilization timeline\n\nBusiness overview, revenue model, and expense structure\n\nComplete financial statements\n\nManagement Discussion and Analysis (future outlook of the business)\n\nKey risks associated with the business\n\nDetails of management and their background\n\nMarketing the IPO\nThe company promotes its IPO through advertisements and media campaigns to create investor awareness. This phase is commonly referred to as the IPO roadshow.\n\nFinalizing the price band\nThe company decides the lower and upper price limits at which shares will be offered. The price band must align with investor expectations; otherwise, the IPO may fail to attract subscriptions.\n\nBook Building\nAfter the roadshow and price band announcement, the IPO subscription window opens. Investors bid for shares within the price band. The process of collecting bids at different price levels is called Book Building, which helps discover the most appropriate issue price.\n\nClosure of the issue\nOnce the subscription window closes (usually after a few days), the final issue price is determined. This price is typically the level at which maximum demand is received.\n\nListing day\nOn the listing day, the company’s shares are listed on the stock exchange. The listing price is decided by market demand and supply and may be at a premium, at par, or at a discount compared to the issue price."

During the book-building process, if bids are received for only 90,000 shares, the issue is said to be under-subscribed. This usually reflects weak demand and unfavorable public sentiment.\n\nOversubscription – If the company offers 1,00,000 shares and receives bids for 2,00,000 shares, the IPO is considered oversubscribed by two times (2x). This indicates strong investor interest.\n\nGreen Shoe Option – This is a provision in the issue document that allows the company to issue additional shares (generally up to 15%) in case of excess demand. It is also known as the over-allotment option.\n\nFixed Price IPO – In some IPOs, the company decides a single fixed price for the shares instead of offering a price band. Such offerings are referred to as fixed-price IPOs.\n\nPrice Band and Cut-off Price – A price band represents the lower and upper price range within which investors can bid. For example, if the price band is ₹100 to ₹130 and the shares are finally allotted at ₹125, then ₹125 is known as the cut-off price.\n\nRecent IPOs in India\n\nBelow is a snapshot of some recent IPOs in India. With the concepts covered so far, understanding this information should now be straightforward.\n\nThe previous sections aim to give you a clear understanding of why companies choose to go public and how the IPO process works end-to-end."

This situation is known as oversubscription.\n\nOn the other hand, if out of the 1,000 shares offered, bids are received for only 900 shares, then the IPO is said to be undersubscribed.\n\nNow, think about what happens after the company gets listed. What if the share price starts declining immediately after listing? This can certainly happen. To address such situations, there is a mechanism known as the Greenshoe Option. Under this option, the underwriters are allowed to purchase up to an additional 15% of the shares at the issue price if the newly listed stock begins to trade below its offer price. This process helps stabilize and support the falling share price in the market."

The management expresses confidence that the new CEO will lead the company towards stronger growth and improved performance.\n\nThis raises two important questions:\n\nHow is Infosys’ stock price likely to respond to this announcement?\n\nIf you were to take a position in Infosys, would you choose to buy or sell the stock?\n\nThe answer to the first question is fairly straightforward. Since the news is positive, the stock price is expected to rise. Infosys was previously facing a leadership concern, and this uncertainty has now been resolved. Whenever positive developments are announced, market participants generally respond by buying the stock at prevailing prices, which often triggers a price rally.\n\nLet’s understand this with a simple illustration.\n\nYou will notice that buyers are willing to accept higher prices quoted by sellers. This behavior indicates a bullish market. In a bullish environment, stock prices tend to move upward as demand outweighs supply.\n\nAs you can see, the stock price increases by Rs. 16 within just 5 minutes. Although this is a hypothetical example, it closely reflects real market behavior. Stock prices typically rise when the news is favorable or when future expectations improve.\n\nIn this scenario, the upward movement in the stock price is driven by positive sentiment and renewed confidence in the company’s leadership."

For those unfamiliar, NASSCOM is a trade body representing the Indian IT industry.\n\nBy 12:30 PM, let us assume Infosys is trading at Rs. 3030. A few questions arise now:\n\nHow does this new information affect Infosys?\n\nIf you were to place a fresh trade based on this update, what would you do?\n\nWhat impact would this news have on other IT stocks?\n\nBefore answering these questions, let us understand the NASSCOM statement in detail.\n\nA likely 15% reduction in IT budgets means that IT companies may see lower revenues and profits in the future. This is clearly negative news for the IT industry as a whole.\n\nNow let us answer the above questions:\n\nInfosys is a leading IT company, and the market will react to this news. Since there was already positive news earlier in the day, the reaction may be mixed. However, a 15% drop in revenue expectations is serious, and hence Infosys’ stock is likely to face selling pressure.\n\nAt Rs. 3030, if one were to initiate a new trade based on this information, it would most likely be a sell on Infosys.\n\nThe statement issued by NASSCOM affects the entire IT sector, not just Infosys. Therefore, most IT stocks are likely to witness selling pressure.\n\nAs you can see, market participants constantly react to news and events, and these reactions directly translate into price movements. This is essentially what causes stock prices to move.\n\nAt this point, you may wonder whether prices move only when there is news. The answer is yes and no, depending on the company and the context.\n\nFor example, consider two companies where there is no specific news:\n\nReliance Industries Limited\n\nShree Lakshmi Sugar Mills\n\nReliance Industries is a large, widely tracked company. Even in the absence of news, market participants actively buy and sell its shares, which causes continuous price movement.\n\nThe second company is relatively lesser-known and may not attract much attention when there is no news. In such cases, the stock price may not move much, or the movement may be very small.\n\nTo summarize, stock prices move based on expectations driven by news and events. These events may relate to the company itself, the industry it belongs to, or even the broader economy. For instance, the appointment of Narendra Modi as the Prime Minister of India was perceived as positive news, which led to a rise in the overall stock market.\n\nIn some situations, even when there is no news, prices can still move purely due to demand and supply dynamics in the market."

When you place the order, the following details are verified:\n\nYour trading account details through which you are placing the order\n\nThe price at which you wish to buy Infosys shares\n\nThe number of shares you intend to purchase\n\nBefore sending the order to the stock exchange, your broker checks whether you have sufficient funds in your account to complete the purchase. If sufficient funds are available, the order is forwarded to the stock exchange.\n\nOnce the order reaches the exchange, its order-matching system looks for a seller who is willing to sell 200 shares of Infosys at Rs. 3030.\n\nThe seller could be a single person selling all 200 shares, or multiple sellers selling smaller quantities—such as ten sellers offering 20 shares each, or two sellers offering 1 and 199 shares respectively. From your point of view, this breakdown does not matter. What matters is that your requirement of 200 shares at Rs. 3030 is fulfilled. The stock exchange ensures this as long as sellers are available in the market.\n\nAfter the trade is executed, the shares are electronically credited to your DEMAT account. At the same time, the shares are electronically debited from the seller’s DEMAT account, completing the transaction."

Your approach is also influenced by the level of risk you are comfortable taking. Broadly, regardless of the method you choose, you will fall into one of two categories — a trader or an investor.\n\nA trader is someone who identifies opportunities and enters trades with the intention of exiting them profitably at the earliest suitable moment. Traders typically have a short-term outlook on the markets. They remain alert during market hours and continuously assess opportunities by balancing risk and reward. A trader is neutral about market direction and can take positions on both the upside (long) and downside (short). The concepts of going long and going short will be explained later.\n\nThere are different types of traders:\n\nDay Trader –\nA day trader opens and closes positions within the same trading day and does not carry positions overnight. This approach avoids overnight risk. For example, buying 100 shares of TCS at ₹2212 at 9:15 AM and selling them at ₹2220 at 3:20 PM results in a profit of ₹800 in a single day. A day trader usually trades in 5–6 stocks daily, sometimes even more.\n\nScalper –\nA scalper is a specialized form of a day trader. Scalpers trade very large quantities of shares for extremely short durations, aiming for small but quick profits. For instance, buying 10,000 shares of TCS at ₹2212 at 9:15 AM and selling them at ₹2212.1 at 9:16 AM yields a profit of ₹1000. Scalpers may repeat such trades multiple times during the day and are typically highly risk-averse.\n\nSwing Trader –\nA swing trader holds positions for a relatively longer period compared to a day trader. The holding duration can range from a few days to several weeks, aiming to capture short- to medium-term price movements."

Unlike a trader, an investor is patient and allows the investment to mature. Investors are comfortable waiting for the business to grow and deliver results. Typically, an investor’s holding period spans several years rather than days or weeks. Broadly, investors can be grouped into two popular categories.\n\n1. Growth Investors\n\nThe goal of a growth investor is to identify companies that are expected to expand rapidly due to favorable industry dynamics, innovation, or long-term macroeconomic trends. These investors focus on future potential rather than current valuations.\n\nA classic example in the Indian market would be investing in companies like Hindustan Unilever, Infosys, or Gillette India during the 1990s. As industries evolved and consumer demand increased, these companies experienced substantial growth, creating enormous wealth for long-term shareholders.\n\n2. Value Investors\n\nValue investors aim to find fundamentally strong companies whose stock prices have fallen significantly due to temporary negative sentiment or short-term challenges. These stocks may belong to either growing or mature businesses but are available at attractive valuations.\n\nA recent example of value investing can be seen during the market crash caused by Covid in March 2020. Due to widespread fear and uncertainty, many high-quality stocks were heavily sold off. However, as sentiment improved, these stocks staged a strong V-shaped recovery in the following months, rewarding patient value investors."

With or without news, market participants actively buy and sell its shares. Due to this constant interest and liquidity, the stock price keeps moving regularly.\n\nThe second company is relatively lesser known. As a result, it may not attract much attention from market participants. In such cases, the stock price may remain stagnant, or even if it moves, the movement is usually minimal.\n\nTo sum up, stock prices are primarily influenced by news and events. These developments may be directly linked to the company, the industry it operates in, or the overall economy. For example, the appointment of Narendra Modi as the Prime Minister of India was seen as a positive event, leading to a broad-based rise across the stock market.\n\nAt times, even in the absence of any news, stock prices can still change due to shifts in demand and supply dynamics."

These stocks together represent the overall state and movement of the economy.\n\nStock Selection Criteria\n\nTo be included in an index, a stock must satisfy certain predefined criteria. These criteria typically relate to:\n\nMarket capitalization\n\nLiquidity\n\nTrading frequency\n\nSector representation\n\nOnce a stock qualifies and becomes part of the index, it must continue to meet these criteria.\nIf a stock fails to maintain the required standards, it is removed and replaced by another eligible stock.\n\nThis ensures that the index remains relevant, representative, and efficient over time.\n\nWeightage of Stocks in an Index\n\nAfter the eligible stocks are selected, each stock is assigned a specific weight within the index.\n\nWeightage determines:\n\nHow much influence a stock has on index movement\n\nThe extent to which price changes in that stock affect the index\n\nFor example, if a stock has a weight of 3.85% in the index, it means approximately 3.85% of the index’s movement can be attributed to that stock’s price movement.\n\nHow Are Weights Assigned?\n\nThere are multiple ways to assign weights, but Indian stock exchanges follow the free-float market capitalization method.\n\nUnder this method:\n\nStocks with a larger free-float market capitalization receive higher weight\n\nStocks with smaller free-float market capitalization receive lower weight\n\nThis approach ensures that companies with greater market participation have a proportionally higher impact on the index.\n\nFree-Float Market Capitalization\n\nFree-float market capitalization is calculated as:\n\nNumber of shares available for public trading × Market price per share\n\nOnly shares that are freely available for trading are considered. Promoter-held shares and restricted shares are excluded.\n\nExample:\nIf a company has:\n\n100 shares available in the market\n\nShare price of ₹50\n\nThen, free-float market capitalization =\n100 × 50 = ₹5,000\n\nImpact of Heavyweight Stocks\n\nStocks with the highest weight in the index are called index heavyweights.\n\nMovements in these stocks have a significant impact on the index level.\nAs a result, the index tends to be more sensitive to price changes in heavyweight stocks compared to lower-weight stocks.\n\nKey Takeaways\n\nAn index is constructed using a defined stock selection process\n\nEach stock is assigned a weight based on free-float market capitalization\n\nHigher market capitalization leads to higher index weight\n\nHeavyweight stocks influence index movement the most"

If the stock price is ₹50, the free-float market capitalization of the company would be:\n\n100 × 50 = ₹5,000\n\nThis value is used to determine the stock’s weight in the index relative to other constituent stocks."

At the market level, if the stock market index declines over a prolonged period, it is referred to as a bear market.\nExample – The market experienced a bearish phase from early 2008 to late 2009.\n\nTrend – The term “trend” generally indicates the overall direction in which the market is moving along with its momentum.

This concept can feel a bit counter-intuitive at first, so let’s understand it with a simple real-life example.\n\nAround mid-2014, Xiaomi entered the Indian market through an exclusive partnership with Flipkart to sell its flagship smartphone, the Mi3. The expected price of the phone was around ₹14,000. To purchase the Mi3, users had to be registered on Flipkart, and the registration window was open only for a limited time.\n\nI registered promptly, but my colleague Rajesh did not. Even though he wanted the phone, he couldn’t buy it due to missing the registration deadline.\n\nOut of desperation, Rajesh approached me with an offer. He said he would buy the phone from me for ₹16,500 and asked me to sell it to him immediately. I agreed, even though I didn’t yet own the phone, and Rajesh paid me the money upfront.\n\nAt that point, I had effectively sold a phone that I did not own. However, I knew I could still purchase it later from Flipkart and deliver it to Rajesh. The risk in this situation was simple—if the phone’s actual price turned out to be higher than ₹16,500, I would incur a loss. For instance, if the price had been ₹18,000, the loss would have been ₹1,500 (18,000 − 16,500).\n\nAs it turned out, the phone was priced at ₹14,000 as expected. I bought it from Flipkart, delivered it to Rajesh, and made a profit of ₹2,500 (16,500 − 14,000).\n\nIf you look closely at the sequence of events, I sold the product first and bought it later.

Yes—by short selling.\n\nYou sell Wipro at ₹425, and after two days, when the stock falls to ₹405, you buy it back.\n\nIn this case:\n\nFirst leg of the trade: Sell at ₹425\n\nSecond leg of the trade: Buy back at ₹405\n\nThis is how short selling works—you sell first at a higher price and buy later at a lower price.\n\nEffectively, this is the same trade as buying at ₹405 and selling at ₹425, but executed in reverse order.\n\nA common question arises here:\nHow can you sell Wipro shares without owning them?\n\nJust like the earlier example where a phone was sold before owning it, the stock market allows short selling under certain rules.\n\nAn important point to remember is that when you short a stock in the cash segment, you must buy it back on the same day before the market closes. This means short selling in the cash market is strictly an intraday activity.\n\nIn the derivatives segment, however, short positions can be carried forward for multiple days. For now, ignore derivatives and focus on the fact that all cash market short positions must be squared off before market close.\n\nKey Takeaways\n\nWhen you short a stock, you have a bearish view.\n\nYou profit if the stock price falls.\n\nYou incur a loss if the stock price rises.\n\nIn the cash market, short selling requires you to buy back the stock on the same day, unless you are using derivatives.\n\nShorting a stock is simple in execution—you select the stock and place a sell order—but it requires clear understanding and discipline."

When you sell to close a long position, it is not considered short selling—you are simply exiting an already open long trade.\n\nIn the same way, if you are short on a stock, squaring off means buying the stock back. When you repurchase the stock, you are only closing your short position; this action does not mean you are taking a long position.\n\nIn simple terms, squaring off always refers to closing an existing position, regardless of whether the position is long or short.\n\nSummary:\n\nWhen you are long, square off by selling the stock\n\nWhen you are short, square off by buying the stock\n\nIntraday Position\n\nAn intraday position is a trade that is opened with the intention of being squared off on the same trading day.\n\nSuch positions cannot be carried forward to the next day. For example, all short positions in stocks (cash segment) are intraday positions and must be closed before the market closes.\n\nIntraday trading focuses on short-term price movements within a single trading session, and positions are automatically squared off by the broker if they are not closed manually."

The detailed interpretation of OHLC will be covered later in the technical analysis module.\n\nExample:\nIf the OHLC values of ACC on 17th June were 1486, 1511, 1467, and 1499, then:\n\nOpen = 1486\n\nHigh = 1511\n\nLow = 1467\n\nClose = 1499"

Each type of instrument differs in terms of risk, return, and trading characteristics. Broadly, the exchange functions through multiple market segments.\n\n1. Capital Market (CM)\n\nThe capital market segment deals with tradable securities such as equity shares and exchange-traded funds (ETFs). Whenever you buy or sell shares of a company, the transaction takes place in the capital market segment.\nShort selling of stocks is also permitted in this segment. The capital market is often referred to as the cash market or spot market.\n\n2. Futures and Options (FO)\n\nThe Futures and Options segment, commonly known as the equity derivatives segment, is where leveraged instruments are traded. This segment allows traders to take positions using futures and options contracts.\nThe derivatives market will be covered in detail in the Futures and Options module.\n\n3. Currency Derivatives Segment (CDS)\n\nThe currency derivatives segment facilitates trading in currency pairs such as USD/INR, EUR/INR, and JPY/INR. Trading in this segment is conducted through futures and options contracts, which is why it is classified as a currency derivative market.\n\n4. Wholesale Debt Market (WDM)\n\nThe wholesale debt market focuses on fixed-income securities, including government bonds, treasury bills, and corporate debt instruments. This segment is primarily used by institutional participants rather than retail traders."
